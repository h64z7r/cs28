Politics of the Global Economy, POLS 2321(802) Fall 2024
Course Description This is a course in International Political Economy (IPE), an interdisciplinary subject that studies   interlinkage between   economics   and politics   at   a   global   level.   To   state   simply,   it   is   about   addressing two   kinds   of   questions-
(a) How do economic relations between countries influence domestic and   international politics?   (b) How do political relations between nations influence international economic policies?The course is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on the history and evolution of   the current world   order with   discussion   on various theories   in   economics   and political   science.   The   second part   focuses   on   current issues in IPE related to globalization   and international trade, economic   development,   democratization and development in less developed countries, climate change, global governance, security,   gender etc.

Key Goals and Learning Outcomes This course aims to equip students with theoretical and analytical tools that   will   enable   them to understand   the   drivers   of   current   global   economic   and   political   order. A   few   of   the   issues   that   will   be   examined   in   the course are   -
•          What   explains   the   rising   backlash   against   globalization   in   many   developed   countries?
•          Why   does   poverty   continue   to   persist   in   large   parts   of   the   world?
•          How do global trade imbalances between the United States   and   China   affect   international politics?
•          What are the implications and causes of   rising economic inequalities within and   between countries?
•          How   do   current   patterns   of   global   production   and   consumption   affect   climate   change?
The analytical tools covered in the class extend well beyond the   scope   of   IPE.   Students will:
•          Learn to know how to use IPE theories and analytical frameworks to analyze      important   developments shaping the contemporary world.
•          By   the   end   of the   course,   students   should   find   most   charts   or   graphs   published   in   the   Financial   Times or the Economist easy to read!
